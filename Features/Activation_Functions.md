# Activation Functions

Activation functions are mathematical functions that determine the output of a neuron given an input or set of inputs. In the context of neural networks, an activation function takes in the weighted sum of all the inputs from the previous layer, applies a transformation to it, and produces an output that is passed on to the next layer. Activation functions are a crucial part of neural networks because they introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing the network to learn complex relationships in the data.

There are many types of activation functions that are commonly used in neural networks, including:

Sigmoid: This function maps input values to output values between 0 and 1, and is often used in the output layer of binary classification models.

Tanh: This function maps input values to output values between -1 and 1. It is similar to the sigmoid function, but the outputs are centered around 0, which can make it easier for the network to learn.

ReLU: This function stands for "rectified linear unit," and it maps all negative input values to 0 and all positive input values to themselves. It is a simple but effective activation function that is often used in hidden layers.

Softmax: This function is often used in the output layer of multi-class classification models. It maps input values to output values between 0 and 1, and the outputs sum to 1, allowing them to be interpreted as probabilities.

Choosing the right activation function can have a significant impact on the performance of a neural network. It is important to experiment with different activation functions to find the one that works best for a particular problem.
