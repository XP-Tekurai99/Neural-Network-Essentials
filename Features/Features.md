Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that are inspired by the structure and function of the brain. They are composed of
layers of interconnected "neurons," which process and transmit information. Neural networks are capable of learning from data and can be used for a
variety of tasks such as classification, regression, and generation.

Here are some common features of neural networks:

- Layers: Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected neurons. The number of layers and the number of neurons in each
  layer can vary depending on the complexity of the task and the amount of data available.

- Activation functions: Each neuron in a neural network applies an activation function to the input it receives from the previous layer.
  The activation function determines the output of the neuron and helps the network learn nonlinear relationships in the data.

- Weights and biases: Each connection between neurons has a weight that determines the strength of the connection.
  Neurons also have a bias term, which is added to the input before it is processed by the activation function.
  These weights and biases are adjusted during the training process to improve the performance of the network.

- Forward propagation: During the forward propagation phase, the input data is passed through the network, and the output is produced by the output layer.
  The output is compared to the expected output, and the error is used to update the weights and biases of the network.

- Backpropagation: During the backpropagation phase, the error is propagated back through the network, and the weights and biases are adjusted to reduce the error.
  This process is repeated until the network converges, which means that the error is minimized and the network is able to accurately
  predict the output for the given input.

- Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a neural network is trained on a limited amount of data and begins to learn patterns
  that are specific to that data, rather than generalizable patterns. This can lead to poor performance on new, unseen data.
  To prevent overfitting, it is important to use a sufficient amount of training data and to use regularization techniques such as dropout.
