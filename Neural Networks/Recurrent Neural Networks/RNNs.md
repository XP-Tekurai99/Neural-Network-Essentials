Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that are specifically designed to handle sequential data, where the order of the input matters. Examples of such data include time-series data, text, speech, and musical notation.

Unlike feedforward neural networks, which take a fixed-length input and produce a fixed-length output, RNNs take a variable-length input sequence and produce a corresponding variable-length output sequence. This makes RNNs well-suited for tasks like language modeling, machine translation, and speech recognition.

The key feature of RNNs is that they have recurrent connections, which allow them to maintain a "memory" of previous inputs. At each time step, the RNN takes the current input and combines it with the previous hidden state (which acts as the "memory"), producing a new hidden state as output. This new hidden state is then fed back into the RNN at the next time step, allowing it to incorporate information from previous inputs.

There are several different types of RNNs, including simple RNNs, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Simple RNNs suffer from the problem of vanishing gradients, which makes it difficult for them to learn long-term dependencies. GRUs and LSTMs were developed to address this issue by incorporating gating mechanisms that allow the network to selectively remember or forget information from previous time steps.

RNNs are a powerful tool for handling sequential data, and have been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks in natural language processing, speech recognition, and other domains.
