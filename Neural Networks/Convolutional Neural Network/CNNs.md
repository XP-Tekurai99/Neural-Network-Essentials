# Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional neural networks are a type of neural network that are particularly well-suited for image recognition and computer vision tasks. They are designed to identify features in images by applying convolutional filters, also called kernels, over the image.

The basic idea behind a CNN is to apply a set of convolutional filters to an image, creating a set of feature maps that highlight different aspects of the image. These feature maps are then fed into a fully connected neural network to make a prediction.

In a CNN, each convolutional filter is a small matrix of weights that is "slid" across the image, one position at a time. At each position, the filter performs a dot product between its weights and the corresponding region of the image. This operation is repeated for every position in the image, producing a feature map that represents the presence of the filter's feature in that region of the image.

CNNs also often include pooling layers, which help to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps and make the network more robust to variations in the input. Pooling layers typically perform operations such as max pooling, where the maximum value in a small region of the feature map is selected and the other values are discarded.

The output of the final convolutional and pooling layers is then flattened and fed into a fully connected neural network to make a prediction.

Overall, CNNs are particularly effective for image recognition tasks because they are able to learn local patterns and features that are invariant to translation and deformation in the input image. By stacking multiple layers of convolutional and pooling operations, CNNs are able to learn increasingly complex and abstract features from the input image, allowing them to accurately classify a wide range of images.
