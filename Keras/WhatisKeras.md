# What is Keras

Keras is an open-source library for building and training deep learning models in Python.
It is designed to be user-friendly, modular, and extensible, making it easy to build complex neural networks on top of it.
Keras is built on top of other popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK, and it can use these libraries as backends.

Keras provides a high-level interface for building and training neural networks, which makes it easy for beginners to get started with deep learning.
It has a simple, intuitive API that allows you to define the layers and connections of your model in just a few lines of code.
It also includes many useful features such as automatic differentiation, weight initialization, and optimization algorithms, which makes it easy to
build and train deep learning models.

Keras is a very popular choice for building neural networks in Python,
and it is used by researchers and practitioners in a wide range of fields including computer vision, natural language processing, and time series prediction.
It is widely supported by a large and active community, which has contributed many useful extensions and libraries that can be used with Keras.
